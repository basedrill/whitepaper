# A Community-Driven NFT Collection on Base Network

## Abstract

Base Drill is a unique NFT collection designed to be at the forefront of the burgeoning Web3 culture on the Base network. Combining creativity, memecoin culture, storytelling, and pure fun, Base Drill offers a collection of 7,777 programmatically generated NFTs, each meticulously crafted with over 200 distinct traits that mirror the spirit of the Base Network community.

## The Tobyverse and the Base Drill Genesis

Central to the Base Drill collection is the concept of Toby worship. Toby, the almighty Toad God memecoin, is a trending figure on the Base Network, and Base Drill NFTs are Toby's devoted disciples. This initial genesis phase will see the minting of all 7,777 NFTs at an attractive price point of 0.000777 ETH.

## Phase 1: Staking for Rewards and Community Growth

Following the successful launch, Phase 1 introduces a staking mechanism designed to incentivize long-term holding and elevate the value of both Toby and Base Drill tokens. Users can:

* Stake Base Drill NFTs: Holders can stake their Base Drill NFTs to earn rewards in $Toby, further boosting the value of both tokens.

This pronged approach aims to achieve two critical goals:

Reduce Token Circulation: By incentivizing staking, a significant portion of both $Toby and Base Drill tokens will be taken out of circulation, fostering a potential price increase.

Spread Staking Awareness: The program introduces the concept of staking and its on-chain reward possibilities to a wider audience.
Complementing the staking initiative, Phase 1 will prioritize fostering a thriving community. We plan to actively collaborate with other NFT projects on the 

Base Network to achieve this by:

Shared Growth: Collaborations will foster information exchange, joint development efforts, and a larger, more engaged community, ultimately benefiting the overall market value of all participating collections.
Community Building: We are committed to building a strong and vibrant community around the Base Drill project.

## Phase 2: Building a Creative On-chain Future

Phase 2 focuses on leveraging the revenue generated from secondary market sales. The core objective is to establish a digital art studio dedicated to:

Interactive Entertainment Development: The studio will produce creative and interactive entertainment experiences, pushing the boundaries of on-chain possibilities.

Empowering Artists and Developers: We aim to create a platform where talented artists and developers can explore their creativity and craft user-friendly, visually stunning on-chain solutions.

## A Community-Driven Future

We acknowledge that the future of the Base Drill project extends beyond our initial vision.  We are committed to an open and collaborative approach, and for that reason, we will rely heavily on the community to guide the project's trajectory. We have a clear starting point, but the ultimate destination will be shaped by the collective vision and input of our community members.

Join us on this exciting journey as we build a vibrant and innovative space within the Base Network ecosystem!
